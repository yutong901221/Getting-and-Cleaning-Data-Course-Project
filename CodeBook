# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
## Data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

## Variables
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 

## Clean Up
* read files include x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test 
* merges x_data, y_data and subject_data respectively by rows
* features contains the correct names for the X dataset
* Uses cbind() to merge a dataset
* calculate the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject by using aggregate()
